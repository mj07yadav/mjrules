# MJRules

## What is MJRules ?
It's a full fledged Rule engine built upon spring boot framework

## Why create a Rule engine from Scratch ?
Because I want to learn how rule engines being made and also wants to create a sophisticated easy to use/extend rule engine in java , on top of that I want to build it as a standalone service as well as a library for internal use in the projects .
